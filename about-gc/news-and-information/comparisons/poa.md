# POA Network

{% hint style="warning" %}
Comparisons were completed when the chain was named xDai Chain. They are likely outdated as the Gnosis Chain pivots to a new Beacon Chain model.

## Differences between POA Network and Gnosis (Formerly xDai) Chain

[POA Network](https://poa.network) is an R\&D organization as well as a network, and the xDai stable chain is a chain originally created by the POA Network. Other POA projects include [BlockScout](https://docs.blockscout.com) and [TokenBridge](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/) (both recipients of Ecosystem Support from the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/)).&#x20;

The first iteration of the xDai chain was modeled after the POA Network chain but included some important updates. xDai was created as the first stable chain, meaning payments and fees were all completely stable and predictable. It inherited the speed and low fees of POA, but allowed for many new kinds of use cases, creating rapid adoption in the community.&#x20;

Gnosis Chain has successfully moved to a permissionless model with POSDAO, making it more decentralized & ideal as a stable payment platform.  **** &#x20;

## Differences between POA token and STAKE token

The POA token is the native currency of the POA Core network. It is used to send transactions on the chain, and to pay fees for those transactions. Validators earn POA for each block that they seal. POA is a volatile token - the price changes based on market forces. This makes it challenging to use for payments as the value can change rapidly. In addition, POA can be bridged to the Ethereum mainnet and used as POA20.

STAKE is an entirely different kind of token - it is used to secure the underlying consensus of a chain. Validators and delegators use STAKE as collateral in a Proof-of-Stake consensus architecture. On the xDai chain, xDai is used for stable transactions (similar to POA, but as a stablecoin) and STAKE protects the underlying consensus (honest validators earn rewards, misbehaving validators are banned).  ****  \
