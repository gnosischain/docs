### ✅ Foundation and Advisor Token Releases: Foundation pledges 100% of token release until end of year to EasyStaking

Tokens were released successfully for Advisors and Foundation as described in the [token release schedule](../../../../for-stakers/staking-with-gno-on-the-gnosis-beacon-chain/stake-token/stake-token-distribution/token-release-schedule.md).  There will now be daily emissions for Foundation and Advisors and circulating supply will adjust accordingly.

To support the protocol, the xDai Foundation announced that all token releases through the end of the year will be sent to EasyStaking! [Read more about this initiative here](../easystaking-launch-initiative.md).

### ✅ Unit Protocol

Unit Protocol is a new decentralized borrowing protocol designed to provide a lot of flexibility for users. When it goes live, borrowers can use a wide range of coins and tokens as collateral for stable loans. In their whitepaper, the primary use case describes using $STAKE as an underlying collateral. We will follow the protocol as it develops.
