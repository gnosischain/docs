## :fire: Token Burn & Public POSDAO Prep

**We've burned 40,000 STAKE tokens on Ethereum and added 2 new validator candidate nodes on xDai**. Each node has received 20,000 STAKE on xDai, the minimum required to become an initial validator, and will be upgraded to validator status shortly. The nodes are running on the [Nethermind ](https://www.nethermind.io/)client, providing additional robustness and decentralization to the network.

The tokens were burned to the Eth2 Deposit Contrac[t. Learn more about why and some future directions for xDai and public POSDAO.](../posdao-prep-and-40-000-stake-burn.md)
