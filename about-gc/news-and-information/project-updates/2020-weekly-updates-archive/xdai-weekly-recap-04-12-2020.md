## ****:euro: **Ramp Fiat -> xDai**&#x20;

Although this announcement occurred last week, we did not include in a weekly update and wanted to highlight this important milestone. A direct fiat-to-xDai onramp has been on our [Roadmap for a long time](../../../roadmap/#fiat-to-xdai-onramp)! We had previously worked with other providers without success, and were excited this collaboration with [Ramp Network](https://ramp.network/) could come to fruition. Ramp is currently [available in many countries](https://support.ramp.network/en/article/what-countries-do-you-support-1ua7sn1/), and they plan to integrate US customers in the near future. Their simple SDK or hosted option allows projects to easily add direct xDai purchases to their apps. We look forward to these integrations, removing one more obstacle for users and creating a seamless crypto experience.

Many projects building on xDai are also competing for quadratic grant funds, check them out to donate a few Dai, which is matched based on community support. Even small donations can help provide essential funding for projects.
