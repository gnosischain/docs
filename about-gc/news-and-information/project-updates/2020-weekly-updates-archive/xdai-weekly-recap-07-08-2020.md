### ✅ 🎉 EasyStaking Launch

Easy Staking officially launched on Wednesday, August 5! Two days later there is over 1M USD value staked in the protocol and growing. We've created some basic instructions to get started, you probably won't need them as the platform is intuitive and easy to manage.

### ✅ xDai + Elrond Partnership

xDai will partner with [Elrond](https://elrond.com/) to architect their interoperability solution. The modified TokenBridge will be implemented to enable cross-chain communication between Elrond and Ethereum.

DeFi solutions continue to grow, and interoperability is needed to provide scalability. Excited to see what comes of this partnership!

## 👷♀ Dev Updates

### ✅ Connext Reddit entry (Spacefold.io) features xDai

In addition to our [entry for the Reddit Bakeoff](https://challenge.xdaichain.com/), [Connext ](https://connext.network/)entered with their spacefold.io demo, which demonstrates state channels connecting xDai to Rinkeby for cross-chain transfers. This is a second method of interoperability for xDai (along with the TokenBridge), allowing for interoperability without intermediaries.
