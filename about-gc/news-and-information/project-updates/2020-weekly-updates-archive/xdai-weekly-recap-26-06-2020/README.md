### Gas Limit Increase

Ethereum Mainnet miners increased the block gas limit from 10M to 12.5M gas/block ([https://ethstats.net/](https://ethstats.net/)). To maintain xDai smart contract compatibility with ETH, xDai validators are also increasing the gas limit. This will result in 20% gains in tx throughput when needed!&#x20;

### Nifty Wallet Update

Nifty Wallet provides native support for the xDai chain. It's a great MetaMask alternative and offers additional functionality. The latest upgrade to 5.1.1 lets users import accounts with 24 word seed phrases,  easily send max balances and more.&#x20;
