Galleass is a fully decentralized, hand painted, age of sail, resource management game running on the xDai blockchain. Created by Austin Griffith (Burner Wallet, DAOG, and many other DApps), Galleass is a relaxing blockchain game which starts by purchasing a Dogger (a ship, for .001 xDai!), then using the ship to catch fish.
