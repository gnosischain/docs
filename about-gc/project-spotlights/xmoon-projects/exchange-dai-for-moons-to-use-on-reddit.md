# Exchange Dai for MOONs to use on Reddit

Many articles have been popping up for people wanting to [exchange their Reddit MOONs for Dai ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/j1lnc0/if\_you\_are\_not\_sure\_how\_to\_convert\_moon\_to\_dai\_i/)and other cryptocurrency. This is made possible thanks to a multi-hop bridging (moving from Rinkeby -> xDai -> Ethereum) with TokenBridge and [HoneySwap](https://honeyswap.org/#/swap) on xDai.

Just as you can convert MOONs to Dai, you can also convert Dai to MOONs. This allows anyone to purchase MOONs and use them to tip other Redditors and even buy coins for exclusive use in the [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) subreddit.

The steps use the same process as the MOON -> Dai conversion, though mostly in reverse.

1\) **Grab some Dai on Ethereum.** You can get it from a CEX, a DEX,  [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap), a friend or a myriad of other ways.

2\) **Bridge your Dai to xDai.** Go to [https://bridge.xdaichain.com](https://bridge.xdaichain.com/), connect your MetaMask to the Mainnet, pay a little Eth in gas and go.\

6\) **Use your MOONS!** Your MOONs should now arrive in your Reddit account. You can use MOONs to tip other users or convert them to coins for use within the r/Cryptocurrency subreddit.
