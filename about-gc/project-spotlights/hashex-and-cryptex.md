### **CryptEx Products**

#### Liquidity Pool (LP) Locker

Internally and externally audited smart contracts for securely locking projectsâ€™ LP tokens for a customizable duration. CryptEx does not have access to the tokens as they are stored in the smart contract and are only accessible to withdraw after the locking period has expired by the same wallet that deposited them.

#### Team Token Vesting (BEP-20)

Another smart contract product that locks tokens distributed to crypto teams upon creation of the token. Similar to the LP locker, this service locks team tokens for a specified duration and can vest tokens over multiple dates.
