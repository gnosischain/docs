## Connect a Wallet

There are several options including MetaMask, hardware wallets, and WalletConnect. WalletConnect allows you to use a 3rd party wallet on your mobile device.&#x20;

1\) Go to the Safe application on xDai at [https://xdai.gnosis-safe.io/app/#/welcome](https://xdai.gnosis-safe.io/app/#/welcome). Click Connect.

### Connecting with MetaMask

1\) Select the MetaMask option in the connect wallet menu. Check that the correct MetaMask account is active and connected to the xDai Network. [Need to add xDai to your MetaMask?](../../../for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup.md)

{% endhint %}

### Connecting with WalletConnect

Current WalletConnect functionality is limited to wallets that support xDai. You can use MetaMask Mobile with wallet connect if you have setup the [xDai custom RPC](../../../for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup.md).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: Some features may not work as expected on xDai, currently we recommend using MetaMask browser extension.
{% endhint %}

If you choose to use WalletConnect, select the WalletConnect option in the connect wallet menu. Scan the QR code with your application and accept the message to connect in your mobile wallet.
