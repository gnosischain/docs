### Previous Case Study

{% hint style="info" %}
The Helena project is no longer operational. We keep this information for historical purposes, with the idea that this case-study can inform new future prediction market platforms on xDai.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The [Helena Network](https://media.consensys.net/prediction-markets-platform-becomes-first-dapp-on-xdai-sidechain-f26e6d691799) was a prediction market running on the xDai Chain. Daily transactions are conducted on the xDai chain to keep gas fees low, and data is synced with the Ethereum mainnet on a regular basis.&#x20;

### Success Factors

{% hint style="success" %}
xDai: The xDai token is pegged to Dai, providing a stable asset for all smart contract interactions. Fixed fees mean 1000s of transactions can be performed for less than $.10
