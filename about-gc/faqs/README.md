## How do I find the information I need?

There is a lot to know about xDai, so we've split the website into several sections, depending on your role and what you info you might need to access.

* **About Gnosis Chain**: General features, overview, latest news and information designed for new users or those who want to learn more about xDai.
* **For Users**: If you want to transact with Gnosis Chain, use DApps, wallets, DeFi etc.
