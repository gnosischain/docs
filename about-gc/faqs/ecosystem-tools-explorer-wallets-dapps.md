# Ecosystem Tools: Explorer, Wallets, DApps

## How can I find statistics on Gnosis Chain transactions, user addresses etc?

BlockScout is a full-featured, open-source explorer that supports GC. It lets you explore all transactional aspects on chain.

## **What wallets are available to use with Gnosis Chain?**

We are fortunate to have the support of quite a number of wallets, including some amazing mobile wallets like AlphaWallet, DEX wallet and Poketto, and web wallets like Portis Wallet. You can use MetaMask, and Nifty Wallet and Saturn Wallet are additional web3 wallets similar to MetaMask but containing additional features that natively support the Gnosis Chain.

When using a wallet, you will use the same `0x` address that you use on Ethereum, just connect to the Gnosis Chain network to get started.

## How can I develop and deploy a DApp on GC?

Since GC is an Ethereum-compatible sidechain, you can use the same tools (like Truffle), languages (Solidity) and environments you are used to using with Ethereum. With a few quick tweaks, your DApp can also be running on xDai. See [Smart Contract Deployment](../../for-developers/developer-resources/smart-contract-deployment.md) for details.

## MetaMask isn't working, what should I do?

This usually happens due to a MetaMask (MM) update and can be fixed by resaving the GC custom network in MM. Follow the same instructions for setup to reset your network to the Gnosis Chain.  [See these instructions](../../for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup.md).
