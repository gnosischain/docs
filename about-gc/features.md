# Features

## xDai Stable Transaction Coin

A stable coin means peace of mind. Predictable currencies allow buyers and sellers to exchange value without the risks of volatility. In the Gnosis Chain implementation, transactions are conducted using xDai, a stable coin with 1:1 value ratio to Dai. Because transactions occur on a bridged chain, they are extremely fast and inexpensive. In addition, transactions and fees are paid with a single coin.

## GNO Staking & GovernanceToken

GNO stakers protect the consensus layer on the Gnosis Beacon Chain. A staker can [run their own validator node](../for-validators/gnosis-beacon-chain-validators-gno.md), or participate in [liquid staking](https://docs.gnosischain.com/liquid-staking) to help secure the chain.

GNO holders can propose and vote on chain updates, spending allocations and more. [Visit the forum to participate](https://forum.gnosis.io/).

## Neutral Network

The Gnosis chain provides a vital public utility for users - the ability to transfer stable value free of speculative concerns, volatility, or FUD (fear, uncertainty & doubt). GC is an independent network, built to support transactions that hold value. When DAI is bridged to GC, it moves to a platform with a clear, transparent purpose; secure & stable transactions on a fast, neutral network.

Open governance, open access, and token stability create a trusted environment for users as well as applications built on top of GC.

## Scalability&#x20;

GC supports low cost, stable transactions for projects and users. High Ethereum gas prices and congestion have made it difficult for the ecosystem to function efficiently. GC provides a compatible chain for projects requiring nano-transactions or complex transactions that may be prohibitively expensive on Ethereum.  GC can scale both vertically (infrastructure and chain parameter optimization) and horizontally (additional chain deployments) to meet capacity requirements.&#x20;

## On-Chain Randomness

Using a RANDAO-based Random Number Generator, validators produce random numbers used for validator selection. These random seeds are also available for usage by contracts deployed to GC. This allows for true on-chain randomness, eliminating the need to rely on a centralized service or 3rd party application. More information on how the RNG works is [available here](../for-developers/on-chain-random-numbers/).

## POSDAO Green Consensus

The GC currently uses a delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism called POSDAO. The [POSDAO white paper](../for-validators/posdao-whitepaper.md) describes all aspects of this new consensus protocol including a complete overview of the theory, rationale, security, and a detailed implementation section.

## Bridges to Ethereum

Two bridges connect GC to Ethereum, supporting seamless two-way asset transfer between chains. Tokens are acquired on the mainnet, then bridged to GC using either the Dai-xDai bridge for transactional tokens, or the OmniBridge for any cross-chain transfers. Once a user is finished transacting or staking, tokens can be bridged back to the mainnet with ease.

### L2 Chain Bridges

Additional bridges exist to move tokens between xDai and other EVM chains, including moving assets between [Binance Smart Chain](https://bsc-to-xdai-omnibridge.web.app/) and Polygon (using the [Connext state channel bridge](https://bridge.connext.network/)).

### Bridged Tokens

View tokens bridged to GC from Ethereum with the [OmniBridge UI ](https://omni.gnosischain.com/)built by [RaidGuild](https://raidguild.org/).
