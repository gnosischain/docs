# Address sets

With Burner Factory you can create a group of addresses though the interface. Once created, you can [airdrop tokens](airdrop-tokens-to-an-address-set.md) to each of these addresses, and [print out and distribute paper wallets](distribute-paper-wallets.md).&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember, Burner Wallets are meant for quick turnaround usage. Because keys are kept in local storage (and printed on paper wallets) Burner Wallets are not secure. But they are perfect for events or for carrying a small amount of crypto.
{% endhint %}

1\) The first step is to create a wallet and possibly a custom token to distribute. Those instructions are here:

* [Creating a Quick Burner Wallet](../creating-a-quick-burner-wallet.md)
* [Creating your own Burner Wallet token](../creating-your-own-burner-wallet-token.md)

2\) Once your wallet is created at burnerfactory.com, go to **Distribution** in the top menu, then select **New Account Set**.

3\) Name the Account Set. This is for internal usage only, choose a name so you can identify the set. Press **NEXT** to continue.

4\) Increase (+) or Decrease (-) the number of accounts (wallets) you want to generate. Keep **Save to LocalStorage** checked, and press **DOWNLOAD BACKUP FILE** to download a JSON file containing addresses and private keys. Click **Save and Close**.

5\) You will return to the main Distribution page, and see your new Account set generated. Click on the account set name you just created.

6\) Next you will have several options. You can print/download paper wallets, or add assets to airdrop to each address. These can occur in either order, although if you are distributing to individuals immediately (and you want tokens or xDai included on a wallet) you may want to airdrop first.
