# Distribute Paper Wallets

1\) Go to the Distribution page and select the **Address Set** you created in the [Address Sets](./) instruction. Click on **PRINT/DOWNLOAD PAPER WALLETS** on the Account Set page.

2\) A popup will open with wallet details.  Name your Paper Wallet in the **Title** field. All paper wallets will populate with this name.

3\) The default wallets shown contain QR codes of private keys. Users can scan into an existing crypto wallet, and a new address will be added containing tokens you have [airdropped](airdrop-tokens-to-an-address-set.md). This works well for the crypto-initiated. Users may need to add the token contract addresses to their wallet in order to view.

To create QR codes that will open a Burner Wallet (a browser wallet containing assets generated when you [created a wallet](../creating-a-quick-burner-wallet.md), better for newer users) press the wallet url dropdown. Select a deployed wallet from the list of wallets you have created.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If addresses are supplied with tokens, make sure the wallet you created also includes this token. If needed, you can go to **Wallets -> Wallet Name -> Assets** and add the token. You will need to Build and Deploy the wallet again to include the token.
{% endhint %}

4\) Your wallets are ready to distribute. You can either:

* **Print Wallet**:  Currently, you can print strips of 6 wallets per page. Each one contains a unique address and private key. Encourage participants to secure these wallets and keep them secret, as anyone can scan in the QR to access and use the tokens.\

* **Download QR Zip**: This will download only the QR images. You can then distribute these as you see fit (for example on the back of a chip or electronically).

5\) When a user scans a Wallet URL, a new Burner Wallet opens in their browser, populated with the distributed tokens and ready for use.
