# Install Gnosis ChainClient - Run a Non-Validator Node

GC currently runs wth OpenEthereum and Nethermind clients. However, active support for OpenEthereum is ending, and it is recommended to migrate to Nethermind. See the migration guide here:

* [OpenEthereum (previously Parity)](parity.md): Rust Client
* [Nethermind](nethermind.md): .NET Client&#x20;
