# Staking with GNO on the Gnosis Beacon Chain

GNO staking is now available for the Gnosis Beacon Chain. There are currently several options:

* [Become a validator](https://docs.gnosischain.com/validator-info): Run your own node using your own hardware or preconfigured hardware from DappNode. Requires only 1 GNO per validator.&#x20;
* [Liquid staking](https://docs.gnosischain.com/liquid-staking): Use Stakewise to stake any amount of GNO. Receive rGNO and sGNO tokens that you can use for other purposes, increasing the utility and liquidity of your tokens protecting the protocol.&#x20;
