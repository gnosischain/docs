# Staking on GC

{% hint style="warning" %}
The following instructions are for validators and delegators of the Gnosis Chain with POSDAO. Following the merge these methods will no longer be applicable.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
* Instructions use the "xDai chain" terminology. All processes are the same for the Gnosis Chain.
* Staking will stop when the merge occurs with the Gnosis Beacon Chain. Until that time, it is still possible to delegate or validate on the GC.
* Staking Stats are available here (Scroll down to find Staking on xDai stats)\
