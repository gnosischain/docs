| Scheduled Withdrawal Availability | 12 hours\* after request, funds are available to withdraw during the scheduled withdrawal window (also 12 hours\*). STAKE price is the price when withdrawn, not the price when withdrawal is scheduled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Scheduled Withdrawal Window       | 12 hours\*. Scheduled withdrawals are available to pull within this time period. If not withdrawn, they are returned to the protocol. **APR is not reset if returned**, funds continue to accrue emissions as before.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Staking APR                       | <p>Up to 15% APR based on 2 factors:<br>   1. Amount of time STAKE is locked in protocol (up to 7.5% based on a <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/2xtimbnzqw">sigmoid function</a>). Sigmoid parameters*: a = 75000000000000000, b = 0, c = 10000000000000.<br>   2. STAKE <code>totalSupply</code> multiplied by <code>totalSupplyFactor</code> (which is 50%*), and the total amount staked by all participants. Up to 7.5%, based on a <a href="https://github.com/xdaichain/easy-staking-contracts/blob/d5a477e4faf83d33901737cb461e97954ac4c1ec/contracts/EasyStaking.sol#L440">linear function</a>.</p> |
| Multiple Deposits                 | Supported. **Each deposit event creates a new deposit ID**. You can manually add additional STAKE to a current deposit using the [`deposit(uint256 _depositId, uint256 _amount)`](https://github.com/xdaichain/easy-staking-contracts/blob/d5a477e4faf83d33901737cb461e97954ac4c1ec/contracts/EasyStaking.sol#L223) function of the EasyStaking contract. UI doesn't support replenishing existing deposits but allows the staker to create multiple deposits. Emission is accrued from time of deposit for each ID.                                                                                                   |
| Partial Withdrawals               | Supported. User can withdraw a partial amount from any deposit, and will receive the withdrawal amount + APR calculated at time of withdrawal. The remaining deposit amount will continue to accrue APR from that point forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Pending Withdrawal                | A withdrawal has been scheduled for a deposit. The window to process the withdrawal is not yet open.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Ready to Withdraw                 | The withdrawal window is open and a scheduled withdrawal is available for processing. This occurs after 12 hours and eligibility remains for 12 hours. Users can enter the amount to withdraw and claim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
