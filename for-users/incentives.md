# Incentives

There are plentiful opportunities üíê to earn incentives on the Gnosis Chain. These include liquid staking, yield farming, lending and more.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Liquid Staking" %}
[Stakewise](https://app.stakewise.io/) offers liquid staking for GNO holders on the GC. Stake GNO to receive sGNO and rGNO, which become liquid assets while your GNO is validating the network. You can use rGNO/sGNO on DeFi protocols to receive additional rewards, compound your GNO, or for lending purposes üîú.

* Go to [https://app.stakewise.io](https://app.stakewise.io) and connect your wallet to the Gnosis Chain to get started.
* [Learn more](https://docs.gnosischain.com/liquid-staking) about liquid staking on the Gnosis Chain.

_Note: If you'd prefer to stake as a validator on the Gnosis Beacon Chain, you can_ [_run your own node and receive an even higher APY_](https://docs.gnosischain.com/validator-info)_._
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Yield Farming" %}
There are many protocols where you can provide token liquidity (token pairs or single token liquidity depending on the app) for a wide variety of tokens, then stake your liquidity to receive additional yield.&#x20;

APYs and incentives can differ dramatically depending on the protocol, amount in the pools, ongoing 3rd party incentive programs and other variables.&#x20;
