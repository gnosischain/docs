A Fiat-xDai gateway is now available for banking customers in more than 40 countries ([complete list](https://support.ramp.network/en/article/what-countries-do-you-support-1ua7sn1/)) with [Ramp](https://ramp.network/).

### Integration Docs for Developers

There are 2 options to integrate Ramp network with an application on xDai.

1. **Hosted Mode**: Simply add a redirect to the ramp network - [https://ramp.network/buy/?swapAsset=XDAI](https://ramp.network/buy/?swapAsset=XDAI) - and include any query parameters with the url. [Instructions for hosted mode](https://docs.ramp.network/quick-start-hosted/).
2. **Embedded Mode**: Use the Ramp SDK, along with `swapAsset: 'XDAI'` to get started. There are [Ramp testing environments ](https://docs.ramp.network/testing-environments)available on Kovan, Gorli and other testnets as well. Instructions for [Embedded Mode & SDK](https://docs.ramp.network/quick-start-embedded). The Ramp widget is optimized for the mobile experience.

[API integration](https://docs.ramp.network/rest-api-reference) is available to customize the user experience and return asset information and prices, events, purchase status and other details.
