# Bridge Governance Board

In response to increased usage and value locked in the xDai bridge and OmniBridge, a proposal was introduced to extend security and decision making powers to a wider group of participants (governors).

The proposal was accepted, and governance by means of a multi-signature Gnosis Safe was put into place initially on the Ethereum side on 2 October, 2020. Once Gnosis Safe was deployed to xDai, updated governance was enacted on the xDai chain on 23 October, 2020.

The governing board is responsible for managing bridge operations on both sides of the bridge (contracts are deployed on the Ethereum and xDai side). 7 signatures are required to approve any management proposal.&#x20;

Operations may include:

* Bridge contract updates.
* Contract parameters updates such as bridge limits, finality threshold, gas price fallback etc.
* Bridge validator parameter updates like changing the validators set or signatures threshold.

All actions are managed through Gnosis Safe accounts, one on the Ethereum mainnet for Ethereum contract side operations and one on xDai for xDai contract operations.
