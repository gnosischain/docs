Users can interact with various dapp services including DeFi, DEX, games, NFT markets, and any other smart contract applications directly via the in-app [dapp browser](https://userguide.dcentwallet.com/native-service/dapp-browser/using-wallet-connect).&#x20;

D’CENT Wallet is a web3 wallet (like MetaMask) and also supports [WalletConnect](https://userguide.dcentwallet.com/native-service/dapp-browser/using-wallet-connect) to connect to dapp services. Simply switch the network setting to xDai network to access xDai-based dapps.
