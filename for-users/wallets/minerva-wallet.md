# Minerva Wallet

**Wallet Type:** [Android Mobile Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=digital.minerva) (iOS coming in the future)

**Description:** [Minerva Wallet](https://minerva.digital/) is the only non-custodial mobile wallet that gives you complete control over your money, data and identities all in one place. It has a very user-friendly approach, supports WalletConnect and is not only multi-network but also multi-account. Efficient and innovative, it also provides privacy and high security; all wrapped up with a cute mascot.

**Use Cases:** Minerva Wallet is built for all EVM-compatible chains with the major purpose of empowering you to be your own sovereign and have full control over all your assets. It grants you fully-enabled DeFi access via WalletConnect, so you can use hundreds of applications to your liking. Its “Multi-Account-Multi-Network” privacy-enabling interface allows you to effortlessly connect with many accounts on multiple networks and most importantly - to manage them with ease.&#x20;

You can also buy crypto on-ramp via [Ramp.Network](../get-xdai-tokens/buying-xdai-with-fiat/ramp-network.md) and create your own Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). But the icing on the cake :cake: **** is the “streaming money” that will soon hit the “released features” list, bringing Minerva to a new level of finesse among mobile wallets.

Minerva is basically a digital version of your regular wallet, able to handle all the things you have in it, but in a superior, tamperproof and highly secure format - managing to stay, amid all that, simple, sophisticated and user-friendly.

* NFT Collections (Coming soon!)
* In App-Swaps (Planned)
* Multi-language UI (Planned)
* Cute and clever mascot (already here since the beginning!)

It’s a big deal. The secret is development that keeps a “smart & easy” design in mind, to reach that magical point where “most convenient” and “most efficient” meet (while also looking good).

Minerva isn’t just a mobile wallet, it’s a close community and shared goals, a surprise at every corner and a new discovery at every use, it’s a “one look worth a thousand words” - and your best friend in the whole DeFi world.

### What the team says

> "Minerva Wallet is built to serve all needs users have to manage their wealth accumulation in crypto. It is like a Swiss Army knife without immediately revealing all its capabilities to ordinary users who might just be looking to store a few tokens or NFTs. Streaming money and identity management are the specialties that really set Minerva Wallet apart from all the other options, making it a truly awesome wallet."\
> – Thomas Zeinzinger, lab10 collective Head of the Board.
