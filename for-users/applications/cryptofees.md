# CryptoFees

CryptoFees.info aggregates daily transaction (tx) fees for different chains and projects. Daily fees are shown as well as the 7 day average. Clicking on a project displays additional information including the fee model, data source and price/marketcap for the project.

Fees are one metric that show real-world usage and adoption.  When users are paying fees to interact with a protocol, it means there is actual activity and economic value in what the protocol/chain offers. Here we can see **xDai is in the top 15** for daily collected tx fees, despite the low cost-per-tx.

For exchanges (like Uniswap), trading fees are displayed, and interest fees are displayed for lending protocols like Aave. For blockchains like Ethereum or xDai, fees show tx fees paid by users. Since xDai is a stable chain, increased transaction fees mean increased usage; price fluctuations do not impact fee costs. In May 2021, we've seen a large increase in fees paid by users, corresponding with all time highs in transactions (and likely a boost from the latest round of [Dark Forest](../../about-gc/project-spotlights/dark-forest.md) :waning\_crescent\_moon:).

When we compare xDai usage to similar chains like Polygon, we see a large difference in collected fees, as well as a big gap in usage trends.

Also of note, both chains experienced a surge in usage on May 19 during the most recent market correction, where many users on all chains were busy assessing and updating their current positions.

### P/S Ratio

Another interesting metric is the P/S ratio, which is annualized and based on 7 day average fees. This number (the price/sales ratio) compares the market price to the amount brought in from transaction fees. It is eye-opening :eyes: to see some of the large discrepancies when looking at real-world usage vs. project valuation.  \
