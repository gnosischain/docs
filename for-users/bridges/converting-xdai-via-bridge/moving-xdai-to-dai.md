# Moving xDai to Dai

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/oKdh2cOOqUs?t=105" %}
xDai - Dai transfers begin at 1:45
{% endembed %}

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend using Chrome + Metamask + No Ad Blockers to complete the process.\
\
You will need a **small additional amount of xDai** to process the first transaction, and an **additional amount of Eth** to process the claim transaction on Ethereum.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important Update**: The xDai bridge has been updated to decentralize withdrawals and give users more control when transferring xDai to Dai on Ethereum. [More information is here](https://forum.poa.network/t/important-changes-in-a-user-interaction-with-the-xdai-bridge/3906). \
\
If you did not use the Bridge UI to process your original bridge request - for example you used xDai.io, a contract call or another platform, you may need to [**find the first transaction hash**](find-a-transaction-hash.md) **** and use the **** [**claim function on the bridge**](find-a-transaction-hash.md#claim-your-tokens) (click on **Haven't received your tokens**) to complete your transfer.

If you experience issues, see the [Troubleshooting page](troubleshooting.md).
{% endhint %}

1\) Go to [https://bridge.xdaichain.com/](https://bridge.xdaichain.com/). [Connect your web3 wallet](../../wallets/metamask/metamask-setup.md) (MetaMask, Nifty Wallet) to the **xDai Chain**. Once connected, you will see your address populated in the header, and your xDai and Dai balance displayed on the page. &#x20;

_Note: If you change the dropdown on the page (xDai Chain) but not in MetaMask, the interface will shift but your wallet will not auto-connect to the chain. Switching chains in MM will automatically shift the interface._

2\) Enter the amount of xDai you would like to transfer to Dai, and click the **Request** button. Note the **minimum amount is 10 xDai.**

3\) Confirm that you will need to perform 2 transactions, and will need xDai and Eth to complete the transfer.

4\) The web3 wallet window will open with transaction details. Click **Confirm** to process the transaction on xDai.

5\) Wait for 8 block confirmations. You will see several popups with block confirmation info.

6\) You will see a modal instructing you switch networks in your MetaMask (or other web3) to the Ethereum Network.

7\) After you switch networks the **Claim** button will appear. Press to proceed.

8\) **Confirm** the second claim transaction in MetaMask (you will need some Eth for gas fees). Once processed, the Dai should be available in your wallet.
