Here we show the bridging steps to transfer STAKE on xDai to STAKE on BSC. The chain names are appended, so the bridged token is called "STAKE on xDai on BSC".

## What you need:

* A [token on the Gnosis chain](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/bridged-tokens/eth) you want to swap.
* A small amount of xDai to complete the transfer. [Use the faucet if you just need some for transactions](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/faucet).
* BNB on the Binance Smart Chain. **You can now get BNB by transferring** [**wBNB from** ](wbnb-auto-conversion-to-bnb.md)**.**\
  _If you have BNB on BEP2 you can also swap it to BSC._ [_Trust Wallet_](https://trustwallet.com/) _works well for this (however Trust Wallet does not yet support xDai, so once you swap you'll need to send BNB from your Trust Wallet to your BSC address in MetaMask for this tutorial)._
* MetaMask custom RPCs [setup for xDai](../../../wallets/metamask/metamask-setup.md) and for the Binance Smart Chain ( Network Name: BSC Mainnet New RPC URL: [https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/](https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/) ChainID: 56 Symbol: BNB Block Explorer URL: [https://bscscan.com/](https://bscscan.com/)) or find [more detailed instructions here](https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/metamask.html).

{% hint style="info" %}
If planning to bridge so you can trade an asset on BSC or xDai (Honeyswap, BaoSwap etc), **check liquidity for that asset on the chain where you want to trade prior to bridging**. \
\
In the example below we bridge STAKE on xDai to BSC, but there may not be enough liquidity for trading STAKE on BSC. In this case you can bridge it back to the originating chain (or if its a supported stablecoin swap on [Component on xDai](https://xdai.component.finance/)).&#x20;
