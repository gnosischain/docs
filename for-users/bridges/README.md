# Bridges

## Bridge Information

* [xDai Bridge](converting-xdai-via-bridge/): Bridge from Ethereum to the GC.  Designed for the xDai native token. Convert Dai to xDai and bridge xDai to Dai on Ethereum.\

* [Omnibridge](omnibridge/): Bridge ERC20 tokens between Ethereum and xDai. OmniBridge is also available for bridging between [Binance Smart Chain and xDai](omnibridge/binance-smart-chain-omnibridge/).

### Multiple Token Instances

With multi-chain bridging, there is a possibility that multiple instances of an underlying asset can be created on a single chain.&#x20;

For example, USDT can be bridged to xDai from Ethereum and also bridged to xDai from BSC. This results in 2 separate USDT token instances on xDai. These tokens cannot be merged into a single instance once they are minted.&#x20;

A suffix is added to the token name in BlockScout, specifying the origin chain of a bridged token (ie. from Ethereum, from BSC etc). Tags indicate a token is bridged, and which chain the token is bridged from. Users can click View Original Token to view the token on the chain of origin.

Though not available for all tokens (pairs can be added as community need arises), **swaps are available for certain cross-chain token pairs using** [**component.finance**](https://xdai.component.finance/)**.**\
