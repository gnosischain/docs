# Lighthouse

### Lighthouse

A secure and fast Eth2 client built by Sigma Prime. [More on Lighthouse and Sigma Prime](https://lighthouse.sigmaprime.io/update-00.html)

Lighthouse is built in Rust under an Apache 2.0 License.

### Using Lighthouse as a Gnosis Beacon Chain Validator

The Lighthouse client has been modified to account for consensus parameters specific to the Gnosis Chain. The original Lighthouse binary will not work with the Gnosis Beacon chain; a configured client is available for users.&#x20;
