# Prysm

### Prysm

[Prysm](https://prysmaticlabs.com), developed by Prysmatic labs,  is a user-focused client with high reliability.&#x20;

Prysm is written in Go and released under a GPL-3.0 license.

### Using Prysm as a Gnosis Beacon Chain Validator

The Prysm client has been modified to update the go-ethereum library for specifics related to the Gnosis Beacon Chain. The original Prysm binary will not work with the Gnosis Beacon chain; a configured client is available for users.&#x20;
