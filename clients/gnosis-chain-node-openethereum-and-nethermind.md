# Gnosis Chain Node (OpenEthereum & Nethermind)

In addition to running a GBC client, we also recommend running a separate Gnosis Chain Node. Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Chain) will be used to process validator deposits and later incorporated as a shard.

While it is possible to link GBC to an existing node using a JSON RPC endpoint, we recommend running your own node to promote decentralization. Gnosis Nodes can be run with your choice of OpenEthereum or Nethermind with the following recommended minimum specs:

* OS: Ubuntu (Nethermind & OE), Windows & MacOs (Nethermind only)
* CPU: 2 cores
* RAM: 4GB
* Disk: 50gb SSD
* Git installed `git --version`

The following instructions are for the xDai chain setup. Instructions will be updated to reflect the naming change, but remain the same in other regards.
