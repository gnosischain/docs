# Clients

Both client instances are modified slightly to support GBC and the original binaries will not work. Please see the relevant page for links and instructions for the GBC-modified client implementations.

In addition to the GBC client, validators will also need to [operate or connect to an operational Gnosis Chain (native xDai) nod](gnosis-chain-node-openethereum-and-nethermind/)e running Nethermind or OpenEthereum.&#x20;
