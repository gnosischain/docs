# Clients

GBC is supported by 2 clients; validators can choose which client they prefer to run.

* [ Lighthouse](lighthouse.md): A fast and secure client written in Rust.
* &#x20;[Prysm](prysm.md): A user-focused client with high reliability written in Go.
* In addition to the GBC client, validators will also need to operate or connect to an operational Gnosis Chain (native xDai) node running Nethermind or OpenEthereum. [More information here](gnosis-chain-node-openethereum-and-nethermind/).
