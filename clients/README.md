# Clients

Both client instances are modified slightly to support GBC and the original binaries will not work. Please see the relevant page for links and instructions for the GBC-modified client implementations.

In addition to the GBC client, validators will also need to connect to a Gnosis Chain RPC node or, optionally, [run their own Gnosis Chain (native xDai) node ](gnosis-chain-node-openethereum-and-nethermind/)with Nethermind or OpenEthereum.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
[DappNode](https://dappnode.io) supports the Gnosis Beacon Chain! If you would like to use their services for validation, please see the [guide and instructions here.](https://forum.dappnode.io/t/how-to-setup-a-gnosis-beacon-chain-gbc-validator-on-dappnode/1351)
