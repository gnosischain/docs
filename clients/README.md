# Clients

Please see the relevant page for links and instructions for each client implementation. The Lighthouse binary v 2.1.2+ supports Gnosis Chain out-of-the-box. The Prysm client is modified slightly to support the GBC and you must use the modified version.&#x20;

In addition to the GBC client, validators will need to connect to a Gnosis Chain RPC node or, optionally, [run their own Gnosis Chain (native xDai) node ](gnosis-chain-node-openethereum-and-nethermind/)with Nethermind or OpenEthereum.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
[DappNode](https://dappnode.io) supports the Gnosis Beacon Chain! If you would like to use their services for validation, please see the [guide and instructions here.](https://forum.dappnode.io/t/how-to-setup-a-gnosis-beacon-chain-gbc-validator-on-dappnode/1351)
