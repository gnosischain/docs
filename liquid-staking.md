# Liquid Staking

## ðŸ’§ Liquid Staking

Liquid staking providers allow anyone to stake without running the infrastructure themselves. Liquid staking has arrived on the GBC with [Stakewise](https://app.stakewise.io). Connect your wallet to the GC to start staking __ today!&#x20;

### Stakewise Basics

1\) Go to [https://app.stakewise.io](https://app.stakewise.io) and connect your wallet (We use MetaMask in this example, you can also use WalletConnect or other options).
