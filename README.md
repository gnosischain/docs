# GBC Introduction

Gnosis Beacon Chain (GBC) brings extendable, beacon-network functionality to the Ethereum 2.0 ecosystem. Applications can iterate through real-world strategies, stage important applications, or choose to run DApps in a faster, lower-stakes environment while enjoying the benefits of massive scalability.

GBC will serve as a final frontrunner prior to important Ethereum 2.0 updates. For example, the merge will first take place on testnets. Updates can then move to a production-level, real-world value environment (Gnosis Beacon Chain).&#x20;

The GBC merge will occur approximately 1 week prior to the Ethereum 2 merge. This final walkthrough will help uncover any overlooked issues and provide a confidence check prior to Eth2 launch.

Validating GBC only requires the equivalent of a single GNO token\*, opening up validation opportunities for diverse groups of individuals across the globe.

## Gnosis Chain

Gnosis Chain (formerly the xDai Chain) is the associated EVM chain for stable transactions. Gnosis Chain uses the xDai token for transactions and includes a wide-ranging group of projects and users.

Much like Ethereum, Gnosis Chain will continue to run in its current form until the merge with the Gnosis Beacon Chain. This is planned for \~ 1 week prior to the Ethereum 2 merge.

After the merge, validators (stakers) on the GBC will begin validating transactions on the Gnosis Chain; the Gnosis Chain will become a shard within the larger GBC infrastructure.

Much more information on Gnosis Chain, usage, and applications is available on the [GC (formerly xDai) site](https://www.xdaichain.com). In addition, here are a few quick links to GC-relevant resources.
