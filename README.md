# Introduction

Gnosis Beacon Chain (GBC) brings vital canary network functionality to the burgeoning Ethereum 2.0 ecosystem. Applications can iterate through real-world strategies, stage important applications, or choose to run DApps in a faster, lower-stakes environment while enjoying the benefits of massive scalability.

GBC will serve as a final frontrunner prior to important Ethereum 2.0 updates. For example, the merge will first take place on testnets, then in a production-level, real-world value environment (GBC) approximately 1 week prior to Ethereum deployment. This final walkthrough will help uncover any overlooked issues and provide a confidence check prior to launch.

Validating GBC will only require the equivalent of a single GNO token\*, opening up validation opportunities for a diverse group of individuals across the globe.

### Clients

GBC will be supported by 2 clients and validators can choose which client they want to run. Note that validators will still need to operate / connect to a Gnosis Chain node running Nethermind or OpenEthereum in addition to running the GBC client.

* &#x20;[Lighthouse](https://lighthouse.sigmaprime.io): A fast and secure client written in Rust.
* &#x20;[Prysm](https://prysmaticlabs.com): A user-focused client with high reliability written in Go.
