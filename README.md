# Introduction

Gnosis Beacon Chain (GBC) brings vital canary network functionality to the Ethereum 2.0 ecosystem. Applications can iterate through real-world strategies, stage important applications, or choose to run DApps in a faster, lower-stakes environment while enjoying the benefits of massive scalability.

GBC will serve as a final frontrunner prior to important Ethereum 2.0 updates. For example, the merge will first take place on testnets. Updates can then move to a production-level, real-world value environment (GBC) approximately 1 week prior to Ethereum deployment. This final walkthrough will help uncover any overlooked issues and provide a confidence check prior to launch.

Validating GBC will only require the equivalent of a single GNO token\*, opening up validation opportunities for diverse groups of individuals across the globe.

_\*1 GNO equivalent. Staking will utilize the mGNO token, where 32 mGNO are equal to 1 GNO._
