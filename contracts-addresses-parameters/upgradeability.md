# Upgradeability

One differentiator for the Gnosis Beacon Chain relative to the Ethereum Beacon chain is the ability to upgrade contracts. A proxy pattern allows for this functionality, which can be extremely useful if an update is required (a bug is found, new functionality added etc).&#x20;

However, this also introduces issues of administrative responsibility. No one entity should solely control contract updates.

A multi-sig Gnosis Safe is used to expand admin responsibilities to a larger entity. The controlling assembly is a Governance Board consisting of known and active projects who have contributed to the Gnosis (formerly xDai) Chain and Ethereum community for some time.&#x20;

A proposed upgrade is presented to this board and a minimum of 7 signatures are required to enact any proposal.
