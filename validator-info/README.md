# Validator Info

The Gnosis Beacon Chain is currently in alpha deployment with a subset of validators.&#x20;

Please see the [Validator Requirements](validator-requirements-and-responsibilities.md) and [Technical Requirements](technical-requirements.md) to learn more about expectations and what you will need to become a validator.

Validating the GBC requires 1 GNO.

There will also be options for validators who want to use staking services (such as StakeFish, Figment and others) as well as validators using DAppNode infrastructure. Look for more details coming soon!

{% hint style="info" %}
DappNode now supports the Gnosis Beacon Chain! If you would like to use their services for validation, please see the [guide and instructions here.](https://forum.dappnode.io/t/how-to-setup-a-gnosis-beacon-chain-gbc-validator-on-dappnode/1351)

:bulb:Want to learn the basics about validating on the beacon chain? [This is a good first article to start](https://medium.com/alethio/ethereum-2-a-validators-journey-through-the-beacon-chain-843f70aaab2e) (covers the Ethereum Beacon Chain, but processes are similar on GBC only faster: 5 sec blocks and 16 slots per epoch).&#x20;
