# Technical Requirements

## The Basics

Since GBC is a smaller-stakes environment, it is a great place to refine new skills. Be sure to read instructions carefully and ask questions ([discord channel](https://t.co/yrSN2dS9Z2)) as needed.

* **Using the Terminal**:  You will be required to enter commands into a terminal window. These will be simple copy-paste instructions, but familiarity with using a terminal is helpful.&#x20;
* **Key Management**: You will use the command line to derive a key-pair for validating blocks as well as a mnemonic you will use later to derive a withdrawal pair. It is important to store these safely (offline highly recommended).

### Connectivity

A reliable internet connection is key - bandwidth should not be throttled or capped. Upload bandwidth should be a minimum of 700 MB/hour with increases likely. Brief periods offline may result in small inactivity penalties, but this will be recouped quickly as long as the outage is short.

Note that synching the execution layer Gnosis Chain may take up to 12 hours depending on your setup.&#x20;

### Security

When setting up hardware or a VM, use proper security measures including securing the root account, setting up a firewall, and forwarding necessary ports to the correct machines from the router.

* OpenEthereum & Nethermind: 30303 TCP/UDP
* Prysm & Lighthouse: 12000 UDP, 13000 TCP

### Time Sync

Your clock should be synchronized to prevent skipping block sealing.

&#x20;Enter`timedatectl status` , you should see similar output:

```bash
Local time: Tue 2020-06-30 17:16:19 UTC
Universal time: Tue 2020-06-30 17:16:19 UTC
RTC time: Tue 2020-06-30 17:16:19
Time zone: Etc/UTC (UTC, +0000)
System clock synchronized: yes
systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes
RTC in local TZ: no
```

If **`System clock synchronized`** displays **`yes`**   you are good to go.

If not, you can either:

* [x] synchronize clock with NTP servers (allow **UDP** port **123** for both incoming and outgoing traffic) or
* [x] use the following script to sync with google.com:

Create `fixtime.sh` script and run it with `watch -n 60` command in a `screen`

```bash
echo sudo date -s '"$(wget -qSO- --max-redirect=0 google.com 2>&1 | grep Date: | cut -d' ' -f5-8)Z"' > fixtime.sh
chmod +x fixtime.sh
screen -S time
watch -n 60 ./fixtime.sh
```

Press `Ctrl+A+D` to leave the `screen`

### Gnosis Chain Execution Layer Node Requirements

It is optional to run your own Gnosis node. You can link GBC to an existing node through a JSON RPC endpoint, and this is the easiest method when you first setup your node. You will be encouraged to update your setup once the merge happens. If you have experience and would prefer to setup your own GC node now, here are the instructions.

GC Nodes can be run with you choice of 2 clients (OpenEthereum and Nethermind) and the following recommended minimum specs:

* OS: Ubuntu (Nethermind & OE), Windows & MacOs (Nethermind only)
* CPU: 2 cores
* RAM: 4GB
* Disk: 100gb SSD
* Git installed `git --version`
