# Validator Requirements & Responsibilities

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are new to validating and interested in becoming a beacon chain validatore, please [fill out this form](https://airtable.com/shrrzJsRLa767gpcQ) and we will contact you regarding next steps.

Before getting started, it is important to have an understanding of your responsibilities as a validator. As an Ethereum-mirrored environment with lower stakes, validating on the GBC involves many of the same responsibilities as validating on the Ethereum Beacon Chain.&#x20;

ðŸ’¡Educating and familiarizing yourself with the [Eth Launchpad Advisories](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/overview) is a good way to get up to speed quickly.

On GBC you can validate blocks with a more reasonable staking amount, providing security and receiving rewards (or penalties) as you would with Ethereum staking. Primary points to consider:

1. The validator deposit is a **non-reversible, one-way transaction**. Withdrawal will not be possible until the Gnosis Chain merge occurs joining the execution layer with the consensus layer.
2. You are **responsible for your node**, including ensuring uptime, correct behavior, and monitoring. If your node is not responding properly, or is displaying dishonest behavior (like running keys on 2 nodes at the same time), you will be penalized in the form of deposit slashing.
3. You are **responsible for your keys** (deriving and storing your keys and mnemonic securely). If you lose, or your keys are compromised, there is no recourse to recover your funds.
4. You will follow the instructions and processes outlined here or with a provider of your choosing (ie DAppNode or Liquid Staking provider). **Failure to follow instructions correctly can result in lost funds.**
5. You provide decentralization and security for the network. **You are vital to the proper functioning of GBC**.

If you are ready to proceed, please see the technical prerequisites which include hardware requirements to get started.
