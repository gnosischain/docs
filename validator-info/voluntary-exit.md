# Voluntary Exit

If you decide to stop validating and disable your node, you can initiate a voluntary exit. This will freeze your balance at its current value (rewards and/or penalties will no longer accrue).&#x20;

If you perform a voluntary exit, you **will not be able to withdraw your balance** until the merge is complete and withdrawals are activated.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Exits are non-reversible; once you have exited you cannot restart your validator.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Voluntary exit procedures vary depending on your client.
