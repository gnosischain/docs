# Validator Withdrawals

Withdrawals are not available until after the merge, when the Gnosis Beacon Chain merges with the Gnosis Chain. Until that time, any mGNO deposits made will remain with the beacon chain.

If you decide you want to stop validating prior to the merge, you can perform a voluntary exit, which will freeze your balance at the current value.&#x20;

We will post more on the withdrawal instructions as the merge approaches. You can find more info in the FAQs.
