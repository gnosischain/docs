# Voluntary Exit

If you decide to stop validating and disable your node, you can initiate a voluntary exit. This will freeze your balance at its current value (rewards and/or penalties will no longer accrue).&#x20;

If you perform a voluntary exit, you will not be able to withdraw your balance until the merge is complete and withdrawals are activated.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Exits are non-reversible; you cannot enable your validator to start earning again once you have exited.
{% endhint %}
